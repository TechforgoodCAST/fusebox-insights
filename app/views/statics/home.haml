        %h4 Simple habits
        %p.mb-4 Having a shared understanding Testing your understanding and ideas Regularly improving your understanding
        %h4 A way of working
        %p.mb-4 ‘Digital’ is about a way of working to respond to changing needs, expectations and behaviours with design and technology.
        %h4 Having the right impact
        %p In the end, it’s all about solving problems that matter by providing well-balanced user, social and financial value. Increasingly we’re seeing the impact of digital services that don’t appropriately account for their social impact, and we know through our work that most social organisations struggle to satisfy user needs in their pursuit for social impact.
