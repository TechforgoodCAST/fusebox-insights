      <p>You can think of an iteration as a short and very focused project.</p>
      <p>Usually between 2-12 weeks long - it involves a team, a deadline and a set of outcomes to work towards.</p>
      <p>By working in small batches it's easier to respond to new information and limit the risk of trying new ideas or making mistakes.</p>
      <p>Because of this, an iteration isn't complete until the team has reflected on what they've learnt and decided on what steps to take next - often another iteration.</p>
